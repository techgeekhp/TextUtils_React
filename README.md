# TextUtils Web Application

This application is made with the `React`.
The application tells the user about the text length , no of whitespaces in the text, to convert whole text into lowercase or to uppercase and a lot much.
I have also used `ReactStrap` to give it a flavour of the famous framework `Bootstrap`. 
The application is responsive and mobile friendly.
